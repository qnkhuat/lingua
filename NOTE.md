# Chapter 2
Abstract Syntax Tree ( AST ) is a tree representation of the code's structure

The syntax is "abstract" in the sense that it does not represent every detail appearing in the real syntax, but rather just the structural or content-related details.

AST is used as data structure for compilers to represent the structure of program code

Outcome of this Chapter is we able to take user input and parse it into AST

# Chapter 3
Transform AST to LLVM IR
